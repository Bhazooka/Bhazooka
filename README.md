# Welcome

I am a Software Engineer with experience in machine learning, data analysis, system design, and full-stack development. My work spans Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, React, Next.js, and cloud technologies. I’ve built projects involving computer vision, reinforcement learning, blockchain, VR simulation, and multilingual LLM development.

I use GitHub to document my learning, explore new ideas, and build practical, intelligent systems.
